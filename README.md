Hereâ€™s a concise paragraph overview:

The weather app utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a responsive and interactive weather forecasting tool. The HTML structure includes a search bar for city input, a display area for weather information such as temperature, conditions, and icons, and an error message section for invalid city names. The CSS enhances the user interface with modern, clean designs, animations, and responsive adjustments for different screen sizes. JavaScript handles the functionality by fetching weather data from an API based on user input and dynamically updating the display, while also managing error states when invalid city names are entered.
